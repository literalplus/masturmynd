Mastur Mynd
===========

A simple text-based implementation of the [Mastermind board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29) in Python. I made this upon playing the game with [benaryorg](https://github.com/benaryorg) via netcat. Sadly, it doesn't yet support multiplayer games, but that functionality might be introduced in a future version.


To play, simply clone this repo and execute the program:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/xxyy/masturmynd.git
python masturmynd.py
````
